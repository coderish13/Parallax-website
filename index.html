        <h2>Ganga Aarti</h2>
        <p>Ganga Arti is perhaps the most famous spectacle at Haridwar. Wooing people from far and beyond, it's an everyday ritual followed at the riverside of Ganga, witnessed by lakhs of onlookers.
            It's a ritual in the honour of the river, with priests using huge brass and silver lamps. Every evening, as dusk descends, the Ganga Aarti is performed at the three holy cities of Haridwar, Rishikesh, and Varanasi in India.
            It's a very powerful and uplifting spiritual ritual. An aarti is a devotional ritual that uses fire as an offering. It's usually made in the form of a lit lamp, and in the case of the Ganges River, a small diya with a candle and flowers that's floated down the river. The offering is made to the Goddess Ganga, also affectionately referred to as Maa Ganga, goddess of the holiest river in India. The aarti takes on special significance on the auspicious occasion of Ganga Dussehra (in May or June each year), when Maa Ganga is believed to have descended from heaven to earth.

        <h2>Hawa Mahal</h2>
        <p>
            Hawa Mahal ("The Palace of Winds" or "The Palace of Breeze") is a palace in Jaipur, 
            India approximately 300 kilometers from the capital city of Delhi. Built from red and pink sandstone,
            he palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.
            The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh,
            who was the founder of Jaipur. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this
            grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five floor exterior is akin to
            honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. 
            The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals
            celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah",
            which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed
            cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high 
            temperatures in summer.</p>

        <h2>India Gate</h2>
        <p>
            The India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch such as the Arch of Constantine, 
            in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.

        <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>
            The Taj Mahal , originally the Rauza-i-munawwara is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658)
            to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history.
            The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
